Exercise 5: More Variables And Printing

Now we'll do even more typing of variables and printing them out. This time we'll use something called a “format
string”. Every time you put " (double-quotes) around a piece of text you have been making a string. A string is how
you make something that your program might give to a human. You print them, save them to files, send them to web
servers, all sorts of things.
Strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make strings that have variables embedded in them.
You embed variables inside a string by using specialized format sequences and then putting the variables at the end
with a special syntax that tells Python, “Hey, this is a format string, put these variables in there.”
As usual, just type this in even if you do not understand it and make it exactly the same.

JOBS :
    - complete the variable to your will (do not forget a string uses quotes numbers don't)
    - run your script : python3 ex5.py
    - compare your result and fix mistakes

RESULT:
$ python ex5.py
Let's talk about Zed A. Shaw.
He's 74 inches tall.
He's 180 pounds heavy.
Actually that's not too heavy.
He's got Blue eyes and Brown hair.
His teeth are usually White depending on the coffee.
If I add 35, 74, and 180 I get 289.
